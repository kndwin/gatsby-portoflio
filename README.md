## Welcome to my source code!
This is my 2nd iteration, the first time I used pure CSS and HTMl. As the project
grew, it got messier. In this iteration, I was more intentional with
1. Reusing code: I fell in love with React component and tried to use it more
2. Modularity: I'd like to make one change without breaking everything else. Using
CSS module really helped with this project.
